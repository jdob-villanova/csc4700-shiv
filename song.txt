Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
- you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important? You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherf-, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage, who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing, or I'm winning
On my momma, that's the realest sh-
Love, let's talk about love

I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved
Like a rebound, got no end game
Got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason (reason)
I ain't just pray for no reason (reason)
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathing
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We were running out of time
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
